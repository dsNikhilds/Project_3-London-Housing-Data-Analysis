This data set includes information of the real estate prices, crime rate of different areas in London.

Data structure: This csv file include 13549 rows and 6 coloumns.

In my opinion the following questions are the most important question in the data set.

1. What are the areas where 'No. of Crimes' is 0. And, how many such records are there ?
2. What is the maximum & minimum 'average_price' per year in england 
3. What is the Maximum & Minimum No. of Crimes recorded per area ?
4. Show the total count of records of each area, where average price is less than 100000.
